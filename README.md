# .files

My [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/). Feel free to use them however you
like.

## Notes

#### Bash
    ./bash

My old bash configuration; now no longer used except when demonstrating to
others that their bash prompt can indeed be customized.

#### Fish

    ./fish
    ├── config.fish.osx
    ├── config.fish.ubuntu
    └── functions

Fish shell configurations (fish is great and I recommend you give it a spin -
especially if you're stuck on bash).

There are separate configs for OS X and Ubuntu because those actually represent
my personal and works machines (respectively). I still need to get around to
pulling out the common stuff into one file (see git).

* `./idea`
 
  Some settings for IntelliJ IDEA when I was using it for some stuff in
university. Probably not useful, and also no longer used. Must. Prune. Some.
Day.

* `./sublime`

  Preferences for Sublime Text. While I've almost entirely switched to vim, these
might still be useful.

* `bootstrap.sh`

  This is where all the magic happens.
