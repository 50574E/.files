# .files

My [dotfiles][]. Feel free to use them however you
like.

The git history is a good place to look if you are curious about something in
this repository.

## Setup

I've set up my dotfiles according to [this guide][guide]. One difference, however,
is that the alias I'm using is `dotfiles` instead of `config`.
