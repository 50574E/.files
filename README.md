.files
======

My rather-modest-but-all-I-need collection of [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/). Feel free to use them however you like!

I'm running OS X Mountain Lion with [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) as the terminal, basically for its split windows and better Unicode support (Terminal.app just refused to play nice with Unicode characters). I also use (and love) [fish](http://fishshell.com/) as my default shell – the bash dotfiles are the old ones. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is my all-purpose text editor, but on the extremely rare occasion that I need to do a quick edit from the command line, I usually open vim, hence the vimrc.
